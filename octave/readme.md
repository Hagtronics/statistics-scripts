To use the Octave (Matlab) script you will need all three ".m" files together in the same directory.
Edit the script: XmR_Chart_Universal.m
Change the target filenemt where the data is stored b changing this line: filename = "WheelersTestData.csv";

I have included the test data file: "WheelersTestData.csv" to test the script.

Output will be two plots.
  Plot 1 = the XmR chart.
  Plot 2 = A Histogram of the input data.
